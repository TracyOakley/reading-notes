## Growth Mindset

**Growth Mindset to me is a mindset of development and change.** The development is a journey and every step along the way is different. The change is the difference in skills and ability to solve problems in new ways that you couldn't before.

## Three Reminders To Stay in the *Growth Mindset*

* Rome wasn't build in a day or even a week.

* There are many approaches to solving problems, try to learn not only how you solve problems, but how others do too.
