# Learning Markdown

To use Markdown for your file, use the .md extension

Key Concepts:
- HTML allows for significant control but slows authoring. Markdown fixes this.
- Website primarily give content. Markdown is the tool to get the best of both worlds speed and control.

'#' is used for Heading and the number of '#' indicate the level of the heading with H1 as the biggest.

Space is very important in mark down. If you dont space after the '#' then you won't get the H1 heading.

** ** or __ __ for Bold Text
* * or _ _ for Italic Text

* or - with a space will give you an unordered list

[text for link](the address of the link)
![text for image](address to the image)

There is more but use a cheatsheet if you need something in particular.
