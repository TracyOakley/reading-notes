## Semantics 

[Developer Mozilla Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

Semantics refers to meaning like what effect does running that line of code have? or what is the purpose rather that what does it look like.

#### In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

there are roughly 100 semantic elements
