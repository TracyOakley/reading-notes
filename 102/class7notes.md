# Class 7 Notes - JS Flow Control

[Back to Home](../README.md)

[Flow Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.  

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when **events occur**.  

[JS Functions W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

function myFunction(p1, p2) {  
  return p1 * p2;  
  }  
   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2

## Function Syntax

+ *function* keyword
+ followed by a name  can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
+ followed by parentheses(may include parameter names separated by commas)
+ code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.}



## JS Operators

+ arithmetic (+, *, ** expon, ++, etc)
+ assignment (=, +=, *=)
+ Comparison (==, ===, != , <, ?)
+ logical (&&, ||, !)
+ Conditional
+ Type (typeof, instanceof)
