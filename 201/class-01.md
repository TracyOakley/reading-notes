[Getting started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) 
This website has alot of good info.

1) My short poem: "HTTP Sends Request"

+ My browser first finds the real address
+ it finds it on the DNS,
+ the browser then sends a request to the server,mmK
+ when the server approves, "200 OK"
+ and starts sending the websites files back .
+ My browser then displays as easy as that.

2) HTML file is parsed first and then requests are send for any CSS or JS links that are contained in the HTML file.

3) You can link images to locations on the internet or you can store them on your server.
