# Class 4 Notes - HTMl Links, JS Functions, CSS Layout Intro

[Back to Home](../README.md)

## [Create a Hyperlink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

1) To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

+ an `<a>` element with a href attribute

2) The href attribute contains what information?

+ Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

3) What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

+ include title attribute for mouse hover.

## CSS - [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow) and [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

1) What is meant by “normal flow”?

+ the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

2) What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

+ Block - fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content

+ Inline - is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements.

3) **Static** positioning is the default for every html element.

4) Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

+ popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

5) What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

+ Rather than positioning the element based on its relative position within the normal document flow, they specify the distance the element should be from each of the containing element's sides. 

## JS - [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

1) Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

+ function declaration where you define what the function do or perform and invocation is where run or use the function.

2) What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

+ parameter are values that are defined so functions need to work and an argument is a specific value that is passed to a function.

## [Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1) Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

+ Engaged Collaboration - It can be difficult to work together if you have separate inputs but when you are focused on one input screen then both have to concur to get the work done.
+ Work environment readiness - Talking it out is way better than just going over it in your head.
