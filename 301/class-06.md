## [Intro to Node JS](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

1. What is node.js?

+ Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
+ Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

+ A performance minded Javascript engine so it takes Javascript that is passed to it from server requests I suppose and it turns the Javascript into native machine code that runs on the machine that asked for it from the server.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

+  Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.
+ Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

4. What is npm?

+ a package manager that comes bundled with Node.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

+ V18.9.0

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

+ 8.19.1

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

+ npm install -g jshint

8. What is node used for?

+ installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
+ one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1.What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  1. Greater Efficiency
  2. Engaged Collaboration
  3. Learning from fellow students
  4. Social Skills
  5. Job interview readiness
  6. Work environment readiness

2.In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

+ Engaged Collaboration has been the most beneficial to me because as students noone knows everything and we can talk out the decisions that we take.

3. How does pair programming work?

+ While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
