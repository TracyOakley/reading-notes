### [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

+ JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
+ JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. For a demonstration of JupyterLab and its features, you can view this video:

### [NumPy](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)

+ NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package
+ Before using NumPy, we’ll first try to work with the data using Python and the csv package.
+ With NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.
