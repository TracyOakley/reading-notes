### [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-run-linear-regressions-in-python-scikit-learn/)

+ Scikit-learn is a Python package that simplifies the implementation of a wide range of Machine Learning (ML) methods for predictive data analysis, including linear regression.
+ Linear regression can be thought of as finding the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points
+ A scikit-learn linear regression script begins by importing the LinearRegression class:
  + from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  + sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression()
  + sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=False, copy_X=True)

### [Linear Regression in Python](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/)

+ Regression searches for relationships among variables. 
+ For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.
+ Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent experience or gender impacts salaries.
+ Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.
+ Regression is used in many different fields, including economics, computer science, and the social sciences. Its importance rises every day with the availability of large amounts of data and increased awareness of the practical value of data.

### [Train & Test Splits](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-test-split-and-cross-validation-in-python-80b61beca4b6)

+ These are two rather important concepts in data science and data analysis and are used as tools to prevent (or at least minimize) overfitting.
+ When we’re using a statistical model (like linear regression, for example), we usually fit the model on a training set in order to make predications on a data that wasn’t trained (general data). Overfitting means that what we’ve fit the model too much to the training data.
