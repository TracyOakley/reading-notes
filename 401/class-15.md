### [Trees - by Code Fellows](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-15/resources/Trees.html)

+ Trees (Binary, k-ary, binary search)
+ k-ary is based on the max number (k) of children
+ binary trees traversals are either depth or breadth first.
+ depth first has 3 ways based on stacks and recursion
+ breadth first has 1 way based on queue and recursion.
+ binary search tree has some structure( structure means some value is attached) and is organized so that the smaller value is to the left and larger is to the right.
