# Things I want to know more about (Python 401)

+ I have to enter alot into the command line. I want to know more about how to create shortcuts or shorthand so that I dont have to type the same thing over and over again. (I like gco main and gcb but I want to improve cd CodeFellow/project/courses/401/lab2 or source .venv/bin/activate)
+ want to know more about the read() and bufferbytes stuff and also get some experience with the error handling

+ I want to learn more about vercel, is it like create-react-app?
