# Data Structures and Algorithms

## [Basic Recursion -Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

+ While Loop can be faster, Recursion is cleaner and remember to have base case and recursive case.

## [Data Structures in 15 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

+ More like in 8 minutes and simply explained. I like the Data Structure Read below better.

## [Big O Explained - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)

+ Another win for the carrier pigeon!
+ the 4 rules, 
+ different steps add the run times,
+ drop constants O(2N) = O(N)
+ different inputs => different variables O(N^2)no => O(a*b)
+ drop non-dominate terms O(n^2+n) => O(n^2)

## [8 Common Data Structures - Read](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42)

+ **Great resource for deciding what Data structure to use.**

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

+ I would say knowing what the data structure will be doing mostly. Like adding or searching or removing or mutating or whatever

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

+ every recursive function has 2 cases - base case and recursive case 
+ So make sure you have a base case that can free you from the recursion and that it is reachable when required
