## [Act like you make $1000/hr](https://anthony-moore.medium.com/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-6ab2302b8e8c)

+ **How you value your time is how you value your life.**

## [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)

+ “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs
+ “Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
+ 1.Understand - now exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
+ 2.Plan - Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
+ 3.Divide - **Pay attention.** This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
+ Get Stuck happens to everyone, keep practicing.

## [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

+ Read the problem completely twice.
+ Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
+ Optimize the manual steps.
+ Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
+ Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
+ Optimize the real code.
+ As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

## [The 5 whys](https://www.mindtools.com/a3mi00v/5-whys)

+ The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

## [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

+ Learn from failures but not focus on failures
+ "gamification"

#### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

  + Problem solving in respect to the importance of time and scope of what can be achieved. (in other words: Realism)
  + Independant operator - require little input for results

#### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

  + Question my assumptions or find out what I am assuming.
  + Verify the assumptions that I can.
  + Break down the problems to simpler parts.
