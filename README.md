# My Reading Notes for Code Fellows (Tracy Oakley) `0969DA`

Growth Mindset to me is a mindset of development and change. The development is a journey and every step along the way is different. The change is the difference in skills and ability to solve problems in new ways that you couldn't before.

*Three Reminders To Stay in the Growth Mindset*
* Rome wasn't build in a day or even a week.
* The goal is to learn and new things take time so patience.
* There are many approaches to solving problems, try to learn not only how you solve problems but how others do too.
