# My Reading Notes for Code Fellows (Tracy Oakley) 

### Growth Mindset

**Growth Mindset to me is a mindset of development and change.** The development is a journey and every step along the way is different. The change is the difference in skills and ability to solve problems in new ways that you couldn't before.

*Three Reminders To Stay in the Growth Mindset*
* Rome wasn't build in a day or even a week.
* The goal is to learn, and new things take time, so patience.
* There are many approaches to solving problems, try to learn not only how you solve problems, but how others do too.

***A little about myself***  
I am a Navy Veteran, and I have always been interested in creating software. Right now, I am in Florida, and I enjoy playing Soccer on the weekend.  

This is a simple note to let you know that markdown doesn't have any kind of autocorect feature. :+1:
